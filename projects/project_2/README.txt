Introduction from the website:
"In this project, you will develop a geographic visualization of Twitter data across the USA.
1. Collecting public Twitter posts (tweets) that have been tagged with geographic locations and filtering for those that contain the "texas" query term,
2. Assigning a sentiment (positive or negative) to each tweet, based on all of the words it contains,
3. Aggregating tweets by the state with the closest geographic center, and finally
4. Coloring each state according to the aggregate sentiment of its tweets. Red means positive sentiment; blue means negative.
